Zomato Data Analysis Project !

Are you curious in what influences Zomato customers' decisions?
I just finished a fascinating project that delves deeply into the data to find important patterns. Here's a preview:

 1 Which kind of restaurant, in your opinion, receives the most orders? 
 2 What is the mean score that most eateries obtain? 
 3 Did you know that the majority of internet meal orders are placed by couples? Identify their typical order expenditure!
 4 who is winning the rating game between offline and online orders?

Through this in-depth examination of consumer preferences, I've been able to develop insights that have the potential to produce significant economic value.
